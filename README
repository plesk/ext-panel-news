Panel News

The extension is a widget for the administrator's Home page in Plesk. It shows the latest news about Plesk (based on an RSS channel). The RSS feed is updated daily.

The following techniques are demonstrated:
* Addition of a widget to the administrator's Home page.
* Periodic data update based on a task scheduler.
* The use of a key-value storage for keeping the extension's data.
* Retrieval of initial data in the post-install script and task scheduling.
